ABOUT
	This repository contains the PhD thesis of Julien Tissier, entitled,

	"Improving methods to learn word representations for efficient
	semantic similarities computations"

	It also contains all the source materials used to produce the thesis,
	including the Latex .tex source files, the images and their respective
	source files to generate or modify them (either the Libreoffice Draw
	source or the Python code) and the slides of the PhD defense.

CONTENT
	This repository is composed of:
	  - chapters/: this folder contains all the chapters of the thesis, as
	    ".tex" source files. There are 10 chapters (from 00-introduction.tex
	    to 09-software.tex), a cover page (000-garde.tex) and the
	    bibliography (99-bibliography.bib).
	  - images/: this folder contains all the images used in the thesis
	    (i.e. with the \includegraphics{} command in the .tex files) either
	    as PNG or PDF.
	  - images-code/: this folder contains the Python code used to generate
	    some plots or illustration images of the thesis with the Matplotlib
	    library.
	  - images-src/: this folder contains the source files of some
	    illustrations images used in the thesis, as Libreoffice Draw files
	    (.odg).
	  - PhD-Defense-Julien-Tissier.pdf: the defense presentation as PDF, 48
	    slides.
	  - PhD-Thesis-Julien-Tissier.pdf: the thesis as PDF, 127 pages.
	  - makefile: used to generate the thesis from source files. Use the
	    command `make` at the root of this repository to produce it. You
	    will need the following tools: make, pdflatex and bibtex.
	  - phd-thesis.tex: the main .tex file, containing all the Latex package
	    to use and the different chapters to include.
